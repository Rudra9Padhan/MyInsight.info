I tried to open the link you gave (https://my-insight-info-sjf4.vercel.app/) and searched the web for a README at that URL, but the deployed site itself doesn’t expose a repository README. I can’t fetch a repo’s README from the deployed Vercel URL alone.

Here’s what I did and what I recommend next:

What I did
- I looked up the URL to find whether a README file was directly reachable from the site or a public repository link. The deployed site is a running app, not a direct view of the repository README.md, so I couldn’t retrieve the README contents from the site alone.

How you can get me the README so I can explain it
- If you paste the README.md text here, I will read and explain it line-by-line or section-by-section.
- Or give me the GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) repository URL for the project (for example: https://github.com/owner/repo). I can then fetch and explain the README.
- If you don’t have the repo link, you can find it on the deployed site by:
  - Looking in the page footer or “About / Source” links for a GitHub link.
  - Viewing the page source (right-click → View Page Source) and searching for “github.com”, “repository”, or a repo URL.
  - Opening developer tools (Network tab) and checking requests that might include a repo URL or a package.json with a repository field.
  - Checking the app’s meta tags (some sites include a repository link in meta or manifest files).

If you want a quick explanation right now
- Here’s what a README for a typical web app like “My Insight Info” usually contains (I can tailor this once I see the actual README):
  - Project title and short description (what the app does).
  - Features and screenshots/demos.
  - Installation / prerequisites (Node version, how to run locally).
  - Usage examples (how to open and use the app, API endpoints if any).
  - Configuration / environment variables (.env keys).
  - Tests and build scripts (npm/yarn commands).
  - Contribution guide, license, and contact/support info.

What I’ll do next (when you choose)
- If you paste the README or share the repo URL, I’ll read it and explain each section, point out any unclear parts, and suggest improvements if you want.
- If you’d like, I can also create a clean README template for this project tailored to the features you describe.

Which of the following would you like to do now?
1) Paste the README.md here.  
2) Send the repository URL (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).  
3) Ask me to generate a README template for “My Insight Info” (tell me key features).
